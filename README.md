## Abstract:
During the Advanced Control 2024-I course at the Autonomous University of Bucaramanga (UNAB), various control techniques were addressed and applied through laboratory experiments. This article aims to compare the implemented techniques by analyzing their performance and efficiency to determine which offers better precision, a greater range, and efficiency in movement control for a 1 DOF bar manipulator. Specific objectives include designing various types of controllers with similar settling times, programming an embedded system for manipulator control and data acquisition, and implementing techniques to minimize the effects of the motor and gear train. Each control technique (PID, LQR, State Space, and Robust Control) will be analyzed based on experimental data obtained from laboratory sessions throughout the semester. The goal is to draw conclusions that contribute to the understanding and improvement of control methods for the manipulator.
